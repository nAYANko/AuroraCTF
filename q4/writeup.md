# Level 3 - Question 4


Description:
<br>
Through a stroke of audacious cunning, you gain the aid of a once-revered veteran of the Legion: the enigmatic G-Toilet. With their begrudging assistance, you uncover the location of the Legion’s current monarch, a figure draped in infamy—the inheritor of the accursed title of The Skibidi Toilet.

Navigating a web of deception, you finally arrive at the coordinates provided by G-Toilet. However, instead of an imposing throne or a fortress, you find yourself standing before the male washroom??? A surreal, almost insulting sight given the gravity of your quest. The door is locked, and its encryption is maddeningly intricate. You’ve encountered nothing like it before—ever-shifting keys, endless iterations, and a requirement to enter a pair of passwords a thousand times. Seems a bit... Bizzare??

“Erm what da sigma?” you mutter, teetering on the edge of exasperation. “What kind of sigma-level rizzler thought this was a good idea?”



# Solution:

This a bin ex challenge hosted on a server, so basically u need to enter pairs of plaintext and ciphertext for an everchanging key, 
Challenge starts from "skibidi = rizzler"
from then key is incremented by 1 each for each correct answer, key array changes to "skibidi" on even correct answer and to "alpha" on every multiple of 100.


Incorrect answers reset the challenge, get to a score of 1000 to win.
