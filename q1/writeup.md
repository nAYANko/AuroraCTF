# Level 3 - Question 1 

Description:
<br>
The traveler discovers that an old friend is stranded in Cultus, a world besieged by the Legion of Astral Toilets. Finding this friend is of the utmost importance—a task shrouded in peril and urgency.

As you enter the chaotic airspace of Cultus, a sudden alert jolts your console. A message arrives—but it is not from the Legion. Something else, lurking in the void, has reached you first. The message is encrypted, its code a swirling anomaly of characters that defy logical patterns. It seems to mock your attempts at decryption with its bizarre complexity. What could it mean?


# Solutuon:
Given a link to a yt video where the variable talks with sigma boi playing in the bg, and a link to the song is put in the description, going over to the comments of the song, find the comment by the variable (can use https://www.hadzy.com/), it would ask the players to check out the variable's threads account. There u can find the ciphertext. The encoding is vigenere cipher with the key being the romanized original lyrics for sigma boi.


Now starting from copying the lyrics top to bottom and trying it as a key. The output is not attained. Now we start removing some of the additional lines that do not belong iin the lyrics, not everything altogether, go one by one.
