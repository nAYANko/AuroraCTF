# Level 3 - Question 3

Description:
<br>
The Legion makes its stance clear: Leave Cultus to their dominion or face annihilation. Their decree is final. Land, and you die. A surge of defiance courses through your veins. You decide to infiltrate Cultus despite the warning, but the planet’s terrain is an unrelenting labyrinth of instability. Jagged cliffs and fissures erupt beneath your feet, and the relentless pursuit by Astral Toilet Special Forces tests your endurance to its limits. Desperation mounts as you search for refuge—a place to regroup, someone to trust. Clinging to hope, you replay the message from The Variable, only to find that its contents have shifted, twisting into something altogether unexpected.



# Solution:
So players are provided with an xor image of Andrew tate and a qr, there's a link to the Andrew image inside the qr, steghide it with pass - "Top G" to get the image, reverse the xor, get to the qr which redirects to a reddit post that contains a website, open the website, it has about 30 images and 10 vids, one of the images is of G-Toilet, a prominent character in the skibidi lore, there are multiple versions of him, going to version 3.0 image, download it and steghide with no pass to get the flag. Number 3 is a reference to the fact that its been 3 years since tate was associated with the term "TOP G".
